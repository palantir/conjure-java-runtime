/**
 * The mechanism (as of 2.5.0) that http-remoting uses in order to throw a RemoteException on failure
 * relies on throwing in the OkHttp interceptor {@link com.palantir.remoting2.retrofit2.SerializableErrorInterceptor}.
 * This bubbles up the stack until it reaches the caller.
 *
 * Unfortunately, this doesn't work when using the Retrofit async features; the exception is thrown in a different
 * thread and the callback never runs.
 *
 * Furthermore, Retrofit provides no obvious plugin point where one can switch this kind of behaviour on a per request
 * basis. Ideally we'd get rid of the {@link Call} returning methods since the
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture} methods entirely supercede; but this would be a breaking API change.
 *
 * So, we have this interface. The intended use is that all calls are tagged with an {@link AsyncCallTag}.
 * If the request is to be called in an async fashion, {@link #setCallAsync()} is called.
 *
 * The interceptor will call {@link #isAsyncCall()}, which will return true iff it was registered in this
 * way. In this case, the interceptor is a no-op.
 *
 * The {@link AsyncSerializableErrorCallAdapterFactory} then handles filling the exception into the response.
