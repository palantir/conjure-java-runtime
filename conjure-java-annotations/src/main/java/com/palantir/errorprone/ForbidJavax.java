/**
 * Annotation applied to any method parameter which requires that all input types
 * include at least one Jakarta EE 9 type, such as <code>jakarta.ws.rs.Path</code>
 * or <code>jakarta.ws.rs.core.Feature</code> instead of the legacy <code>javax</code>
 * versions of those.
 *
 * This sprinkling is required since many methods take a simple <code>Object</code> type
 * and let Jersey determine what to do with the object at runtime. In order to obtain better
 * compile time checking, this method can be applied.
 *
 * This is primarily depended on by the gradle-baseline errorprone tooling.
