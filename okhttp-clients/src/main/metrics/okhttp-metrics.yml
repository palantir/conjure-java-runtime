        docs: |
          Timer representing how long it takes to acquire ConcurrencyLimiter permits. (<1ms acquisitions are considered successful, so not included in this 'slow-acquire' timer).

          OkHttpClients acquire a ConcurrencyLimiter permit (scoped to each particular endpoint) to constrain the number of in-flight requests if the server is overloaded.
          Any acquire that takes less than a millisecond is considered to be successful - this 'slow-acquire' timer measures any that take longer than a millisecond,
          indicating that conjure-java-runtime is trying to avoid overloading a server.

          Meter indicating a client timed out waiting for a ConcurrencyLimiter permit, so the limiter was reset to avoid infinite waiting.
