  description: "For a single JaxRsClient request, all spans are now correctly attributed
    to a single traceId. Newly introduced spans are:\n- `OkHttp: Attempt X` (first
    one will be `Attempt 0`, max is still 4 retries for a total of 5 reqs) \n- `OkHttp:
    client-side-concurrency-limiter 4/10` (showing number of inflight request / current
    limit)\n- `OkHttp: dispatcher` (signifies a client may have hit the
    max requests per host)\n- `OkHttp: backoff-with-jitter`\n- `OkHttp: wait-for-headers`\n-
    `OkHttp: wait-for-body`"
