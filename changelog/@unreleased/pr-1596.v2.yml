  description: All jaxrs clients use dialogue transport. This can result in subtly
    different behavior, but is not expected to be noticeable in the vast majority
    of cases. Transport failures will manifest as DialogueException instead of FeignException
    in most cases, some tests may need to be updated. Concurrency limiters and node
    selection are handled entirely by the dialogue implementation.
