    Jersey has been upgraded from 2.25.1 to 2.29. This changes a lot of transitive dependencies. In order to pass `checkRuntimeClasspathClassUniqueness`, you may need to add the following:
    ```gradle
    allprojects {
      dependencies {
        modules {
          module('javax.ws.rs:javax.ws.rs-api') {
              replacedBy('jakarta.ws.rs:jakarta.ws.rs-api', 'Oracle have trademarks forced Eclipse to rename https://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/2019/04/04/renaming-java-ee-specifications-for-jakarta-ee/')
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
