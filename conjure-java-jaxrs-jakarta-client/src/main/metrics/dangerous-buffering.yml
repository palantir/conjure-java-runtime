          Meter incremented each time a feign client is used to send or receive streamed binary data by the number of 
          bytes sent or received (minimum one such that empty streams are recorded).
          Feign should never be used in this way because it fully buffers the request and response internally,
          resulting in heavy heap pressure. Dialogue clients are preferred as they do not cause such heap churn,
          and allow streaming beyond two gigabytes of data.
